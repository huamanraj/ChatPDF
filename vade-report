# React Flight / Next.js RCE Advisory - Remediation Report

## Summary
Successfully addressed the React Flight / Next.js RCE advisory (CVE-2024-50854) by upgrading Next.js to the patched version.

## Vulnerability Assessment
**Affected Packages Detected:**
- ✅ `next@16.0.6` - VULNERABLE (required upgrade)

**Not Affected:**
- ✅ No React Flight packages detected (`react-server-dom-webpack`, `react-server-dom-parcel`, `react-server-dom-turbopack`)
- ✅ `react@19.2.0` and `react-dom@19.2.0` are not directly vulnerable per the advisory

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
1. **package.json**
   - Upgraded `next` from `16.0.6` to `16.0.7` (patched version)
   - Upgraded `eslint-config-next` from `16.0.6` to `16.0.7` (for consistency with Next.js version)

2. **bun.lockb**
   - Updated lockfile to reflect patched dependency versions
   - Ran `bun install` to ensure lockfile consistency

## Rationale
- According to the vulnerability advisory upgrade rules, Next.js 16.x should be upgraded to `16.0.7`
- No changes needed for React or React DOM as they are not directly vulnerable
- No React Flight packages are used in this project, so only Next.js upgrade was required
- Bun was selected as the package manager (detected by presence of `bun.lockb`)

## Verification
✅ Build completed successfully: `next build` completed without dependency-related errors
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ All 11 static pages generated successfully
✅ Project structure preserved - only dependency versions updated

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - 2 lines modified (next and eslint-config-next versions)
- `bun.lockb` - Updated by package manager to reflect new dependency versions

## Important Notes
- The project uses Bun as its package manager
- Build environment variables were required but not included in version control (expected)
- No application logic or structure was modified - only security patches applied
- The deprecated middleware warning in the build is not related to this security update
